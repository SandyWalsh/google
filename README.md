Messing around with Google Calendar access

If you have two-factor authentication turned on, you'll need to create an application-specific password for this to work. 

Go to your Google account page and click the Security tab. Then under 'Connected applications and sites' click 'Manage Access'. Under 'Application-specific passwords' enter a name for this application and then click 'Generate Password'. This is the password you should put in your local_settings.py file.
